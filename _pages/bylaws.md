Nonprofit bylaws are a nonprofitâ€™s operating manual. It is both a legal document and a roadmap for the organization. The SCCGI bylaws are available online by clicking the link below. For a printed copy, please attend one of our public SCCGI Board of Directors meetings held in Slab City. Check our [SCCGI Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/SCCGinc/) for meeting dates.
