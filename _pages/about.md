### Why You Should Support SCCGI
#### SCCGI – LAND FOR PEOPLE, NOT FOR PROFIT

The 21st Century world is far different than the Twentieth Century world. Old solutions lead to new problems. New problems seem to be without solution.

SLAB CITY COMMUNITY GROUP INC. (SCCGI) is a non-profit 501 (c)(3) organization consisting of a group of residents, visitors and friends of Slab City.

Slab City is a self selected, open, intentional, unique off-the-grid community in the Northern Sonoran Desert (Colorado Desert) approximately 4 miles east of Niland, California in Imperial County, California, USA.

SCCGI works to facilitate access to affordable living space for everyone. Slab City has been an accessible living space for over 50 years. We work to sustain, encourage and participate in this unique off-the-grid community.

##### WHY IS SCCGI THE NONPROFIT TO SUPPORT?

Slab City pioneers have been creating new solutions for over 50 years. We are a virtual living laboratory by resident experimentation by living off the grid in an area of scarce resources, often, under harsh weather conditions. Slab City is a viable and vibrant community.

##### WHAT IS SCCGI DOING DIFFERENTLY?

It is time to share. SCCGI is working to sustain Slab City as a living laboratory. We encourage 21st Century Pioneers and Partners to come and participate in developing new living strategies. We are living alternative, new solutions.

##### WHAT’S SPECIAL ABOUT OUR VOLUNTEERS, CONSTITUENTS, GEOGRAPHY, PROGRAMS, EVENTS?

Residents, visitors and volunteers who are part of this “living laboratory,” work proactively to create low environmental impact, self-sustainable, and accessible methods and practices in: off-the-grid living low resource agriculture land stewardship micro-business development life skills education community interaction artistic expression as a way of life and self management.

There are more than 1.8 million charities in the United States right now. And – let’s be honest – many do important work, but… Slab City is Unique. Slab City Residents and visitors have been here for about 50 years. In all that time, the community was self managed. Self managed…with NO government nor municipal structure. And it works quite well. People help their nearby campers if in need. Creativity explodes in an environment where there are few rules. Acceptance and tolerance learned by living and interacting with people from all walks of life and different mental or physical challenges.
